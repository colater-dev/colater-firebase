# Google Sign-In Fix - Action Items

## What I Just Did

1. ✅ Added detailed error logging to the auth redirect handler
2. ✅ Added visible error message display on the sign-in page
3. ✅ Fixed the Firebase auto-config 404 error
4. ✅ Created debug documentation

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Check Firebase Console (CRITICAL)

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/studio-6830756272-ca1a2/authentication/providers

1. **Enable Google Sign-In**:
   - Click on "Google" in the sign-in providers list
   - Make sure the toggle is **ENABLED**
   - Click "Save"

2. **Add Authorized Domains**:
   - Go to Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
   - Make sure these domains are listed:
     - `localhost` ← **CRITICAL for local development**
     - `studio-6830756272-ca1a2.firebaseapp.com`
   - If `localhost` is missing, click "Add domain" and add it

### Step 2: Test the Sign-In Again

1. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Click "Sign in with Google"**

4. **Check for error messages**:
   - After redirecting back, you should now see a **red error box** if something fails
   - The error will tell you exactly what's wrong

### Step 3: Check Browser Console

Open DevTools (F12) and look at the Console tab:
- Look for any red errors
- Look for the console.log messages showing error details
- Share the error code if you see one (e.g., `auth/unauthorized-domain`)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "auth/unauthorized-domain"
**Solution**: Add `localhost` to authorized domains in Firebase Console

### Issue: "auth/popup-closed-by-user"
**Solution**: User cancelled sign-in, try again

### Issue: No error shown, just redirects back
**Possible causes**:
1. Google provider not enabled in Firebase Console
2. Third-party cookies blocked in browser
3. Browser extension interfering

**Try**:
- Open in incognito/private mode
- Try a different browser
- Check if Google provider is enabled

### Issue: 404 error for `/__/firebase/init.json`
**Solution**: Already fixed! This should be gone now.

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Correct flow**:
1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirect to Google sign-in page
3. Select your Google account
4. Redirect back to your app
5. Brief loading screen ("Loading user session...")
6. Redirect to `/dashboard`

❌ **Current issue**:
Steps 1-4 work, but step 5 fails and redirects back to sign-in page

## Debug Output You'll See

After my changes, you should see in the browser console:
```
Error processing redirect result: [Error object]
Error code: auth/unauthorized-domain (or other code)
Error message: [Detailed message]
```

And on the page:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Authentication Error                │
│ This domain is not authorized...    │
│ [Dismiss]                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Next Steps After You Test

1. **If you see an error message**: Share it with me (the exact error code/message)
2. **If it works**: Great! The issue was the Firebase Console config
3. **If still failing silently**: We'll add more detailed logging
