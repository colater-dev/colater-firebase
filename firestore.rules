/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All data is nested under
 * /users/{userId}, and only the authenticated user with the matching {userId}
 * can read or write that data.  Subcollections inherit this ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/brands/{brandId}: Brands owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/brands/{brandId}/inputVersions/{versionId}: Brand input versions.
 * - /users/{userId}/brands/{brandId}/taglineGenerations/{generationId}: AI-generated taglines.
 * - /users/{userId}/brands/{brandId}/logoGenerations/{generationId}: AI-generated logos.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The 'userId' field is present in all documents nested under `/users/{userId}`. This redundancy allows simpler and faster security checks using the `isOwner()` function without needing extra `get()` calls.
