Logo generation
- [ ] The color logo generation flow right now returns odd results - I want the logo to be as close to the current one, but with colors being used like a designer may create color and black and white versions of a logo. 
- [ ] Does the prompt used for the logo generation get saved to Firebase? If not, save it to Firebase. Stop showing it on the UI in the textbox.
